1. Which coding style suggestion do you want to use (or avoid)?
All of these coding suggestions should be avoided. I can see where each one can
make the life of a maintainer more difficult. It's better to be clear with the meaning
and definitions of variables and methods than to have them be confusing. It's also
important that variables are distinct and hold data that you'd expect from the name.
The same for methods, they should do what you'd expect from the name.
