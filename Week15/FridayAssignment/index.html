                <p>Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae (/ˈɜːrsɪdiː, 
                    -daɪ/). They are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans.
                    Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread,
                    appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout most of the Northern
                    Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on 
                    the continents of North America, South America, and Eurasia. 
                    Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky 
                    legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws 
                    with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.</p>
