1. What is Maven?
Maven is a Build tool for Java.

2. What lifecycle phases will run when executing the mvn install command?
The Maven docs mention that the install command will install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally. 

3. What lifecycle phases will run when executing mvn test on a maven project with one file App.java containing:
    public class App {

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello, world!") // HINT: Notice the missing ; (What will this cause to happen?)
        }

    }
It looks like it builds the project, or attempts to and fails, and never makes it to the test phase.

4.  What does mvn clean do?
It removes all files generated by the previous build.

5. What are the 7 phases of the maven default lifecycle in order?
Validate -> Compile -> Test -> Package -> Verify -> Install -> Deploy

6. Come up with a mnemonic for remembering the 7 phases of the maven lifecycle and write it here.
Very Certain The Package Vanished Into Dust
