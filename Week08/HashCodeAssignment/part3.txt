1. The HashCode-Equals contract specifies that objects must equal themselves, that if one object equals another then it should be symmetrical, that if object a equals object b and object b equals object c then object a must also transitively equal object c, and that the equals method should be consistent and change only if a property changes. The hashcode method should also be consistent with the values it returns, and only change when a property changes, objects equal to each other should return the same hashcode, and that unequal objects may have the same hashcode called a collision.
2. If two objects have the same hashcode, they might not always be equal to each other. Sometimes unequal objects get assigned the same hashcode, and this is called a collision.
3. Using the Math.random() method is inappropriate for the hashcode method, as it violates the Hashcode contract, which states that the hashcode method should be consistent with the values it returns, and only change when a property changes. Math.random() would deliver random (inconsistent) results.
